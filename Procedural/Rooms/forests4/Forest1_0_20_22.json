Thick grass blankets the top of the hill.  Before you, whole trees have been woven togther to form a dense wall of branches.  You circle the wall until you find an opening.  Before the door, bones lie scattered around a smoking firepit.  This must be an ogre's lair.  Not far away, the brush and trees thicken as the forest grows deeper."}, "m_doors": [{"code": "Forest1_0_19_21", "dir": "nw", "status": "open"}, {"code": "Forest1_0_20_21", "dir": "n", "status": "open"}, {"code": "Forest1_0_20_23", "dir": "s", "status": "open"}, {"code": "Forest1_0_21_21", "dir": "ne", "status": "open"}, {"code": "Forest1_0_21_23", "dir": "se", "status": "open"}]}
