A tumble of old branches lie strewn across the sand. A fetid stench fills the air, a dark musky scent.  Between two large boulders, a yawning tunnel opens into darkness.  Bones lie scattered around the opening, gnawed with huge teeth.  You have come across a werewolf's den. Nearby, the canyon opens into a dry wash."}, "m_doors": [{"code": "SkoleCracks_0_0_9", "dir": "s", "status": "open"}]}
